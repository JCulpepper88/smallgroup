<!--This will be a discription of the Small Group-->

<p class="serif xxlarge center blue">
<strong>Welcome!</strong>
</p>

<p class="serif large center red">
As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have 
received. Be completely <br> humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. 
Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit <br> through the bond of peace. There is one 
body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were <br> called; one Lord, 
one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and
in all. <br>  - Ephesians 4:1-6

<p class="serif large">
Welcome to the men's bible study group from Church of the Highlands.  This group meets in the 
Hoover area of Alabama.  In this group, we study books of the bible, topics of the bible, or go 
through bible studies from books or videos.  This group is about more than bible study, however. 
 We build relationships with one another, support each other during trials in life and 
celebrate all the good things!
</p>

<!--From here down is discriptions of the rest of the website.-->

<p class="serif large">
On this website, you will find several tools to help you interact with the small group.
</p>
<ul class="serif large circle">
<li>
On the <a href="prayer_requests.html"> <b>Prayer Requests</b></a> page, each week's prayer requests 
will be listed for reference.  In addition, each member will be able to add prayer requests from a 
computer.  The list is only viewable from a mobile device.  However, to keep these private, a password
is required to view the list.  This password will be given out in the group meetings.
</li> <br/>
<li>
Moving to the <a href="study_topics.html"> <b>Study Topics</b></a> page, you will find previous 
and current studies the group has gone through.  Since this website is beginning in 2018, that 
is as far back as you will be able to see.
</li> <br/>
<li>
The <a href="calendar.html"> <b>Calendar</b></a> page links to a Google calendar which is set up 
for the small group.  It will reflect the meeting schedule for the group, any weeks we may be 
skipping, as well as any other extra events (going out to eat, a birthday gathering, etc.) we may 
decide we want to do.
</li> <br/>
<li>
<a href="announcements.html"> <b>Announcements</b></a> will be anything we want to communicate to 
the group.  Most of this should go out through text messages, but it will be kept here for 
reference.  Non-urgent messages, such as information about previous study material, will not 
be texted out.  Therefore, new information will show up on this page occasionally.
</li> <br/>
<li>
On the <a href="contact_info.html"> <b>Contact Info</b></a> page will be listed the names, pictures, 
phone numbers and email addresses of the group leaders.
</li> <br/>
<li>
The <a href="resources.html"> <b>Resources</b></a> page is a list of links to outside resources the 
group leaders feel are of value to group members.  This list will likely change over time, so please 
alert one of the group leaders if you have a recommendation for a good resource.
</li>
</ul>
