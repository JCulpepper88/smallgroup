Hi, I'm John.  I grew up in the Birmingham area and was a member of Gardendale's First Baptist Church 
for nearly 25 years.  However, I began attending a Church of the Highlands small group in the summer 
of 2017 and then moved to Church of the Highlands, attending the Grants Mill campus, with my wife, 
Lacey in January of 2018.  Lacey and I began dating in 2009 and got married in 2014.  We currently 
live in Gardendale and have two cats.
</p>
<p class="serif large">
I went to Samford University and got my Bachelor's degree in Political Science.  Later, I got my 
Master's degree in Political Science from Southern New Hampshire University.  I currently work at the 
Samford University Library, which is convenient for finding sources to develop material for the small
group lessons.
</p>
<p class="serif large">
I currently have a few different hobbies/interests/things I do because I figure it'll make me a better 
person:
<ul class="serif large">
<li>Working out</li>
<li>Playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf" target="_blank"> disc golf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank">Reading</a></li>
<li>Learning to code (now you know why we have a website - for me to practice!)</li>
<li>Learning Hebrew (sporadically, which is, of course, the most efficient way to learn a language)</li>
<li>Watching Alabama football</li>
<li>Studying to better understand the bible</li>
<li><a href="https://www.chess.com/" target="_blank">Chess</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cubetools.net/" target="_blank">Rubik's Cube</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" target="_blank">Go</a> 
(a Chinese game roughly 3,000-4,000 years old) (I get intereseted in it about twice per 
year, <a href="https://online-go.com/" target="_blank"> play online</a> and then burn out)</li>
<li>Having stimulating conversation and learning (hence my involvment in this small group)</li>
</ul>
