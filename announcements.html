Minor change to accomadate the schedule of the three leaders, we will move the small group meeting 
from Thursday to Tuesday.  This means our first meeting will actually be September 4 and we will end on 
November 27.  We will still skip the week of Thanksgiving.  This gives us a make-up week in case 
something unexpected comes up.  I'm getting excited, we're almost there!

The fall semester small group schedule has been released and runs from September 2 through December 1.  
This means our first date to meet will be September 6.  We will meet each Thursday from 7 PM until about 
8:30 PM.  We will skip meeting November 22 since that is Thanksgiving.  We will meet the following 
Thursday, November 29, for our final study of the fall.

During the spring, we studied the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1efzwl0jesa5na9YX4Tsi1SqgBuYkvNTO?usp=sharing" target="_blank">
<i>Killing Kryptonite</i></a> course by John Bevere.
That ebook and the audio files are available in my Google Drive.  The link
for this is on the <a href="study_topics.html"> <b>Study Topics</b></a> page.  For the coming Fall semester, I believe
we will be studying the Minor Prophets.  These are the 12 books of prophecy at 
the end of the Old Testament.  This means we will cover one book per week except 
for one week in which we will have to combine two books.  I am currently preparing 
for this and have completed the book of Hosea.  I am now working on Joel.
